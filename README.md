# Open Tip

Open tip is a decentralised restaurant system where staffs in the restaurant are paid their tips on the blockchain.
It features some important functionalities like -

- Staff registration: Staff register with their preferred unique identifier which is tied to their wallet address.
- Customers can tip staffs: Customers can tip staffs using their unique identifier alone, which will send the funds associated to the wallet address.
- Customers add a warming message to tip: When tipping staffs, customers can also add a warming message just to encourage the staff in what they do.
- Staffs can see history of all tips given to them: Once logged in with a registered wallet address (as a staff), you will be directed to your dashboard where you can see all the tips sent to you, including the message, amount sent, and the date and time of the transaction.

## Motivation 
What motivate me to work on a project like is is how [Unstoppable Domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/), [ENS](https://ens.domains/), and [Near](https://near.org/) blockchain attach wallet addresses to domain names. The idea behind this is to make the blockchain more accessible for the average user.

## Pages
This decentralised application has two pages: The `Home` page and the `Staff` page.
- Home page: This is the page you will first see if you are not registered as  staff. From this page, you can chose to tip a staff or register as a staff
- Staff page: This page is what you see after registering as a staff. It shows a list of all the tips you have received along with their details such as sender, amount, message, and timestamp.
